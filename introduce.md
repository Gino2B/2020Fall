My name is Gene Baybay and my major is computer science. I am a senior so I have taken all the computer science courses up to my cs3. I am only missing Operating systems and Software engineering for the core knowledge classes but I feel as that’s about it when it comes to those classes. As for programs, sadly I haven’t done much programming outside of the labs that were needed of me though I definitely should and I will definitely start since I am nearing my end of my college experience. At least undergraduate wise. As for projects the same goes as previously stated but I did have experience in coding a very basic website in html in high school but that's about it. When I say basic I mean VERY basic. 
Now when it comes to this course I did see how much you are expecting of us in this course. I haven’t done any big projects so when I heard the final project is a semester long fitness app we program ourselves I am frankly a bit scared but I am also excited because this is the hands on real experience I am looking for, not some knowledge dump class. I prefer to learn hands on and I think this class will provide that. It will also push me to do more outside of class to keep up because right now I think I am behind. I hope to be able to accomplish these milestones.
